   <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm runs as the input size grows.
It tells you how the running time increases, using terms like O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²), etc.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs as its input size grows. When an algorithm uses additional storage proportional to the number of elements it processes, we describe its Space Complexity as O(n), meaning the memory required increases linearly with the input size.</p>
